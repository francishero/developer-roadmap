> What is the trend for IT field?

Ok so i will start with programming languages.
<h1>Java</h1>
<p>Java is the most common beginner language offered by most universities.
Java is used to program some many things:
<br>Native Android are written using java</br>
<br>Java Web applications can also be done using Java</br>
<br>Servers can be written using Java</br>
In short Java can write all kinds of applications.But the question is how long will it take for a complete beginner to learn Java and apply it effectively to make applications? Its a little longer than other languages like Javascript and python
</p>

<h1>Python</h1>
<p>
Python is the most beginner friendly programming language and can be used to make any kind of application you can think of.Python is used to make network applications,games and all sorts of things.
<br>
The good thing about python is that it can be learned and applied in a short amount of time as opposed to Java.</br>
</p>
<h1>AI</h1>
<p>AI is a broad field and requires a whole different level of knowledge,but the most common language used for AI development is Python.So this gives python an advantage</p>


***

<h1>Javascript</h1>
<p>Javascript is the most popular and the king of web development.
Learning Javascript requires a little bit of HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge. But once mastered javascript can be used to not only make Webpages but also to write Backend systems.
As it stands Javascript has something called `Javascript fatique`. What this means is Javascript has so many tools and frameworks and for beginners its easy to get lost.
As you can see in the images attached.
</p>

***
<h1>What to teach for BootCamp</h1>
<p>
For absolutely beginners and just getting started with programming PYTHON.
Its easy to understand and grasp the concepts and fundamentals of programming.
After python they can easily get into web development either using python itself or learn something new like Javascript.
<br></br>
<p>
For those who want to learn a specific language Java is the way to go.

## ðŸ‘½ Back-end Roadmap

For the backend, personally I would prefer Node.js and PHP 7 for the full time. Plus, I have been experimenting lately with Go and I quite like it. Apart from these, if I have to choose another one, I would go for Ruby. However this is just my personal preference, you can choose any of the shown languages and you will be good.
